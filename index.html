		<h2>Welcome to KETNYO Herbal Clinic</h2>
		<p>KETNYO Herbal Clinic uses plants and plant extracts to treat terminal illness and diseases such as cancer. Every culture of every era has, until recently, depended on plants for healing. We blend traditional wisdom with modern scientifically validated plant extracts to create medicine for diseases which are known to have no cure. </p>

		<p>We refer patients to conventional doctors for checkups and vice versa thus bridging the gap between modern and traditional medicine. All patients must been screened and checked by a hospital doctor before we can begin treatment. The decision to administer herbal medicine is based upon a patients hospital report and is usually last and only solution. We collaborate with medics in Kapenguria Hospital and Moi Teaching and Referral Hospital in doing our operations.</p>

		<h3>Our Mission</h3>
		<p>To bring hope, health and well-being to patients by providing herbal treatment to terminal diseases.</p>

		<h3>Our Vision</h3>
		<p>We strive to rid the world of cancer and terminal illnesses.</p>

					<h4>Dr. Richard Loitangole</h4>
					<p>Dr. Loitang’ole inherited the art of herbal cure from his grandparents who were traditional herbalists. As a young boy, he used to be sent to bring herbs and plants. He was taught how to prescribe and measure herbs for treating cancer and other diseases.</p>

					<p style="font-style: italic; font-size: 0.8rem; padding: 0 20px 0 20px;">"We remove the spot where cancer cells are and apply medicine. We then administer herbal medicine orally to the patient. After full treatment, patients go for screening to check if they are completely cured. I treat all types of cancer and that is why many conventional Doctors come to me. Many come here after exhausting all the money in big hospitals. Initially, we started by treating people free of charge."</p>
